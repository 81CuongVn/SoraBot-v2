# systemd(1) configuration file for Sora
#
# >>> This is a "dist-file" and thus expects to be modified. <<<
#
# Take a look at the commented entries below.
# These are the ones you'll probably want to change.
#
# In case you need a tutorial:
# - Make sure that you ran "dotnet restore"
# - Make sure that your "config.json" is complete
#
# - Modify all values in this file that are commented.
#   They control important (and possibly security-relevant) settings that are server-specific.
#
# - Copy this file to "/lib/systemd/system"
# - Execute "systemctl enable sora0.service"
#   - This links the file to "/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/"
#
# - Double-Check that all values below are correct
#
# - Done! You can now use the usual control commands:
#   - journalctl -u sora0
#   - systemctl start sora0
#   - systemctl stop sora0
#   - systemctl restart sora0
#
# To uninstall this service just disable it ("systemctl disable sora0").
# Delete "/lib/systemd/system/sora0.service" afterwards if you want.
#
# If you need more help or have no idea what's going on, try one of these:
#   - "man 1 systemd"
#   - "man 1 systemctl"
#   - "man 5 systemd.unit"
#   - "man 7 bootup"
#   - google

# You can comment this out but remember that systemd will run your app as root if you do that.
# Don't believe anyone who says that always running userland apps with sudo/root is a good idea.
